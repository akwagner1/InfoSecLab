## Initial configs
1. Change time zone
2. Add static IP 192.168.0.102 and disable IPv6
3. Install roles: DNS Server and AD DS
4. Once installed, click on flag at the top right and Promote this server to a domain controller
5. Add a new forest, wagco.com
6. Follow prompts, leave everything as is
7. Create new account and add to admin groups, disable default admin account
8. Ensure you can properly login and utilize admin privileges with the new account before disabling the built-in admin account!
9. Rename server name to DNS-DC01 and restart
10. I disabled CTRL-ALT-DEL at the lock screen. Not only is it annoying as is, but it causes issues when inputting the keys from a local machine. Your local machine will take the key input in regards to itself, rather than the VM you are working with. You could select the Vmware option to input those keys directly into the VM, but I disabled the feature altogether.
From the VM OS: Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options > Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL > Enabled
