●	I disabled CTRL-ALT-DEL at the lock screen. Not only is it annoying as is, but it causes issues when inputting the keys from a local machine. Your local machine will take the key input in regards to itself, rather than the VM you are working with. You could select the Vmware option to input those keys directly into the VM, but I disabled the need to altogether.
○	From the VM OS: Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options > Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL > Enabled
