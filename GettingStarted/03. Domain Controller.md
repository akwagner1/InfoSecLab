## Initial configs
Once the OS is installed, login to the administrator account with the password you created during setup. Once you load into the desktop, the Server Manager Dashboard will open. This is where we will do the rest of our configuration. 
1. Click on Configure this local server.
2. Change the time zone to your appropriate zone.
3. Add static IP 192.168.0.102 and disable IPv6
4. In the upper right of the dashboard, click on Add Roles and Features. Install the following roles: DNS Server and Active Directory Domain Services.
5. Once installed, click on flag at the top right and Promote this server to a domain controller.
6. In this wizard, you will add a new forest. Name it according to what you desire your domain name to be. 
7. Follow the prompts, and leave everything else as is.
8. Once it is finished, reboot and change the computer name to what you want. I used DC-01 to help distinguish this as the domain controller. You will need to reboot again.
9. Create a new account for yourself using the Active Directory Users and Computers option under Tools. Add it to the appropriate admin groups, and disable default administrator account.
** Ensure you can properly login and utilize admin privileges with the new account before disabling the built-in admin account!
11. Rename server name to DNS-DC01 and restart
12. I disabled CTRL-ALT-DEL at the lock screen. Not only is it annoying as is, but it causes issues when inputting the keys from a local machine. Your local machine will take the key input in regards to itself, rather than the VM you are working with. You could select the Vmware option to input those keys directly into the VM, but I disabled the feature altogether.
From the VM OS: Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options > Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL > Enabled
