# VMware ESXi Installation
## Introduction
In this Information Security lab, we will use VMware ESXi as our hypervisor. It is a Type 1 hypervisor, meaning that runs directly on our hardware and requires no host operating system to function.
VMware ESXi is commonly used in enterprise environments for its efficiency and performance. Although many organizations are moving to the cloud, it is still good to have a foundational understanding of on-premises solutions. This also offers us more control and customization over our hardware, network configurations, and security measures. It will also offer better performance since we are directly interacting with the hardware. Managing and troubleshooting physical hardware gives a deeper understanding of IT infrastructure.
1. Connect the USB drive to the server that has our VMware ESXi ISO burned to the root directory.
2. Boot or reboot the server to our USB device. We will select F11 upon boot.
3. Enter the setup process, and select our RAID configuration to install the OS on.
4. Select a password that includes upper case, lower case, numbers, and symbols and a length of at least 8 characters.
5. Once setup is complete, remove the USB and reboot the server.
6. Input the username (root) and password, and configure a static IP. Ensure this IP is not already in use.
7. Follow the rest of the on screen prompts. Once completed, use the IP address we selected in Step 6 on our local desktop/laptop's web browser. This will bring us to the hypervisor management page.
Now, we can begin installation and setup of our virtual machines. Click [here]() to begin setup of our first VM, which will be a Windows server acting as our domain controller.
