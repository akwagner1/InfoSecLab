# Dell PowerEdge R620 Server Setup Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Dell PowerEdge R620 Server Setup Guide**. This document provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up the **Dell PowerEdge R620** server to create the **InfoSecLab**. This setup will serve as the foundation for simulating real-world IT and security scenarios in the lab environment.

While this guide is based on the Dell PowerEdge R620, you can adapt these instructions to fit other hardware setups as needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. **Dell PowerEdge R620 Server**
2. Power cables (two for the R620), network cables, keyboard, mouse, and a monitor with a **VGA port**.
3. At least **three RAID-compatible hard drives** for configuring **RAID 5** (striping with parity).
4. **VMware ESXi ISO image** for installation.
5. Two **USB drives**:
   - One for the ESXi ISO.
   - One for the latest **iDRAC firmware** (for later installation).
6. A computer or laptop with network connectivity to verify remote management configuration.

## Hardware Setup

The hardware setup process is fairly straightforward. Follow the steps below to prepare the **Dell PowerEdge R620**:

1. **Power Setup**:  
   Connect the server to a power source. The **R620** has two power supplies, so you'll need two available outlets (or connect it to a **UPS** if you have one set up).

2. **Connect Peripherals**:  
   - Connect the **monitor** to the **VGA port** at the rear of the server.
   - Plug in the **keyboard** and **mouse** into available **USB ports** (found at the rear of the server).

3. **Install Hard Drives**:  
   Insert at least three hard drives into the **front bays** and ensure they are properly seated.

4. **Network Connection**:  
   - Connect the **network cable** to the first **Ethernet port (NIC 1)** at the rear of the server (we’ll use NIC 1 for simplicity).
   
5. **Power On the Server**:  
   - Press the **power button** located on the front left of the server (next to the drive bays).
   - The server will start the **POST** process, and you should see output on the connected monitor.
   - If you encounter any errors, refer to online resources or manuals for troubleshooting.

Once the server powers on, you're ready to proceed with **System Setup**.

## System Setup

Now we will configure the initial setup of the server using **System Setup** and the **Lifecycle Controller**. This will include configuring a static IP address, setting up the default gateway, DNS servers, and RAID configuration.

### Enter System Setup Menu

1. **Access System Setup**:  
   - After powering on the server, it will automatically load into the **Lifecycle Controller**. However, we need to press **F2** to access **System Setup** first.
   - Select your desired **language** and **keyboard** options.

2. **Network Configuration**:  
   - In the **Network Options** section, select **NIC 1** (the network port you connected the cable to).
   - Set a **static IP address**. Ensure the IP is not already in use on your network (you may choose an IP between **100-200** if you have a subnet with available addresses).
   - Set the **subnet mask** (typically **255.255.255.0**).
   - Enter the **default gateway** and **DNS servers**. You can use the IP address of your home router for both.

3. **VLAN Configuration**:  
   - For now, leave the **VLAN** setting **off**. We will configure this option later if needed.

### RAID Configuration

In this section, we'll configure **RAID 5** using the **Lifecycle Controller**. RAID 5 provides a good balance of redundancy, capacity, and performance, with striping and parity across three disks.

1. **Reboot the Server**:  
   - After exiting **System Setup**, reboot the server and press **F10** to enter the **Lifecycle Controller**.

2. **Configure RAID**:  
   - From the **Lifecycle Controller** home page, select **Configure RAID**.
   - Your RAID controller should automatically be selected. Click **Next**.

3. **Select RAID Level**:  
   - Choose **RAID 5** from the list of available RAID levels. Click **Next**.

4. **Select Physical Disks**:  
   - Select the three physical disks you want to include in the RAID setup.
   - Click **Next**.

5. **Name the Virtual Disk**:  
   - Give the new virtual disk a name, such as **RAID5** (no spaces allowed).
   - Leave the other options as default and click **Next**.

6. **Review and Finish**:  
   - Review the configuration details to ensure everything is correct.
   - Click **Finish** to begin the RAID configuration. This process may take a few minutes.

While the RAID array is being configured, grab a snack and relax — it will take some time to complete.

Once the configuration is done, you’ll be ready to proceed with **VMware ESXi installation**. You can follow the detailed steps in the [VMware ESXi Setup Guide](https://github.com/akwagner1/InfoSecLab/blob/main/Lab%20Setup/02.%20VMWare%20ESXi.md).
