# VMware ESXi Installation

## Introduction

In this **Information Security** lab, we will use **VMware ESXi** as our hypervisor. ESXi is a **Type 1 hypervisor**, meaning it runs directly on hardware without the need for a host operating system. It is commonly used in enterprise environments due to its efficiency, performance, and scalability.

Although many organizations are moving to the cloud, understanding on-premises solutions like ESXi is crucial. It provides more control and customization over hardware, network configurations, and security measures. Additionally, working with ESXi gives you deeper insights into IT infrastructure management and troubleshooting.

## Installation Steps

Follow the steps below to install **VMware ESXi** on your **Dell PowerEdge R620**.

1. **Prepare the USB Drive**:
   - Connect the USB drive containing the **VMware ESXi ISO** to the server. Ensure that the ISO is burned to the **root directory** of the USB drive.

2. **Boot the Server from USB**:
   - Power on or reboot the server.
   - During the boot process, press **F11** to enter the boot menu and select the USB drive as the boot device.

3. **Enter the Setup Process**:
   - Once the server boots from the USB, it will start the ESXi installation process.
   - Select the RAID configuration (the one you set up earlier) where you want to install the ESXi operating system.

4. **Set the Root Password**:
   - Choose a strong password for the **root** account. Your password should include:
     - Uppercase letters
     - Lowercase letters
     - Numbers
     - Symbols
     - A length of at least **8 characters**

5. **Complete the Installation**:
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the ESXi installation.
   - Once the installation is complete, remove the USB drive and reboot the server.

6. **Initial Configuration**:
   - After the server reboots, log in using the **root** username and the password you just set.
   - Configure a **static IP address** for the ESXi host. Make sure the IP address you choose is not already in use on your network.

7. **Access the ESXi Management Interface**:
   - Follow the remaining on-screen prompts to finish the basic setup.
   - Once setup is complete, open a web browser on your local desktop or laptop.
   - Enter the **static IP address** you configured in Step 6 to access the ESXi management page.

You are now ready to begin creating and managing virtual machines within your **InfoSecLab**.

## Next Steps

With **VMware ESXi** successfully installed, the next step is to create and set up your **Domain Controller** virtual machine. Click [here](https://github.com/akwagner1/InfoSecLab/blob/main/GettingStarted/Domain%20Controller.md) to begin the setup of the first VM, which will act as a **Windows Server** and serve as the domain controller for your lab.
