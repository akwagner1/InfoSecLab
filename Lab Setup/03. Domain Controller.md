# Setting Up a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller

## Introduction

This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough to configure a **Windows Server 2022** virtual machine (VM) as a **Domain Controller** within the lab environment. The **Domain Controller** will manage user accounts, authentication, and permissions across the network. Follow each section carefully to ensure proper setup and functionality.

## Creating a New VM

1. **Log into VMware ESXi Web Client**:  
   Open your web browser and log into the **VMware ESXi web client**.

2. **Upload the Windows Server ISO**:
   - In the ESXi web client, navigate to **Storage** in the left-hand menu.
   - Select the datastore where you want to upload the ISO (e.g., **datastore1**).
   - Click **Datastore Browser**, then click **Upload** and choose the ISO image file from your local machine.
   - Wait for the upload to complete. Once finished, the ISO image will be available in the datastore for use.

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - In the ESXi web client, click **Create/Register VM**.
   - Select **Create a new virtual machine** and click **Next**.

4. **Configure VM Settings**:
   - Enter a name for the VM (e.g., **DC-01**).
   - **Compatibility**: Leave at default unless specific compatibility settings are required.
   - **Guest OS Family**: Select **Windows**.
   - **Guest OS Version**: Choose **Microsoft Windows Server 2022 (64-bit)**.
   - Choose the datastore where the VM will be stored, then click **Next**.

5. **Assign Resources**:
   - Assign the desired number of **CPUs** (preferably at least 2), **memory** (4GB or higher), and **hard drive space**.
   - Select **Datastore ISO File** and browse to the Windows Server ISO file you uploaded earlier.

6. **Finish VM Creation**:
   - Review the configuration, then click **Finish** to create the VM.

## Installing Windows Server 2022

1. **Start the VM**:
   - From the **Virtual Machines** dashboard, select your new VM and click **Start**.

2. **Begin Installation**:
   - Once the VM boots, click **Install Now** on the main setup screen.

3. **Select Edition**:
   - Choose **Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience)** or **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (Desktop Experience)**. The Desktop Experience is recommended for lab purposes, as it provides a GUI.

4. **License Agreement**:
   - Read and accept the license terms, then click **Next**.

5. **Choose Installation Type**:
   - Select **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)** to perform a fresh installation.

6. **Select Disk for Installation**:
   - Choose the appropriate drive (select the main drive for OS installation if multiple drives are available) and click **Next**. The installation will begin, and the server will restart automatically after completion.

7. **Set Administrator Password**:
   - After the server restarts, you will be prompted to set up an **administrator password**. Enter a strong password and note it down securely.

8. **Login**:
   - After setting the password, log in to the **Administrator** account to finalize the setup. The **Server Manager Dashboard** should open automatically.

## Initial Configurations

Once the OS is installed and you have logged into the administrator account, the **Server Manager Dashboard** will open. From here, we will complete the necessary configuration for the Domain Controller.

1. **Configure Local Server**:
   - Click on **Configure this local server**.
   - Change the **time zone** to your appropriate time zone.

2. **Set Static IP**:
   - Set a **static IP** (e.g., **192.168.0.102**) and disable **IPv6**.

3. **Install Roles**:
   - In the **Server Manager** dashboard, click on **Add Roles and Features** in the upper-right corner.
   - Install the following roles:
     - **DNS Server**
     - **Active Directory Domain Services**

4. **Promote to Domain Controller**:
   - Once the roles are installed, click the **flag** icon at the top-right and select **Promote this server to a domain controller**.

5. **Configure Domain**:
   - In the wizard, select **Add a new forest** and enter your desired **domain name** (e.g., **lab.local**).
   - Follow the prompts and leave the default options unless specific changes are needed.

6. **Reboot and Rename Computer**:
   - Once the setup is complete, reboot the server.
   - Change the computer name to **DC-01** (or another name of your choice to indicate this as the domain controller). You will need to reboot again for the name change to take effect.

7. **Create New Admin Account**:
   - Open **Active Directory Users and Computers** (under **Tools**).
   - Create a new **admin account** for yourself and add it to the appropriate admin groups.
   - **Important**: Disable the default **Administrator** account, but **ensure you can properly log in and use admin privileges with the new account** before disabling the default account!

8. **Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL** (Optional):
   - If you prefer, you can disable the **CTRL+ALT+DEL** requirement at the lock screen (it can be problematic when interacting with VMs).
   - To disable this, navigate to **Local Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options** and enable **Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL**.

## Next Steps

Now that we have successfully created and configured our **Domain Controller**, the next step is to set up our **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** system. We will be using **Wazuh** for our SIEM solution on an **Ubuntu server**.

Click [here](https://github.com/akwagner1/InfoSecLab/blob/main/Lab%20Setup/04.%20Wazuh%20SIEM.md) to begin the process of setting up Wazuh.

We will also be setting up a **file server** using another **Windows Server 2022** instance, along with several other VMs to act as clients and services. These VMs will all be added to the domain, and Wazuh agents will be deployed on them. Eventually, we will simulate compromised machines for incident response and remediation training, but for now, we will focus on setting up and using the **Wazuh SIEM dashboard**.
