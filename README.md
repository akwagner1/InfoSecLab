# InfoSecLab
VMware ESXI lab for studying networking, information security, and automation.
## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to create an environment to develop practical skills and gain hands-on experience in different areas of information security, including but not limited to:
* Setting up and managing virtual machines (VMs) within a commonly used enterprise hypervisor, VMware ESXI
* Implementing network security controls
* Configuring and monitoring intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
* Deploying and integrating Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions
* Exploring security automation and orchestration (SOAR) tools for incident response
* Testing and evaluating new network security products and features
* And more...
## Lab Components
This lab consists of the following key components:
* **Hardware Setup:** Utilize one or more Dell PowerEdge servers as the virtualization platform.
* **Virtualization:** Install VMware ESXI as the hypervisor on the PowerEdge servers to create virtual machines (VMs) for various security tools and systems.
* **Networking:** Configure a physical firewall (e.g., pfSense) as a gateway between the lav network and the internet, providing security and VPN capabilities.
* **Domain Controller:** Set up a Windows Server as a domain controller to manage user accounts and provide centralized authentication services.
* **Client Machines:** Create multiple VMs (Windows and Linux) to simulate different network endpoints, servers, and clients for testing and demonstration purposes.
* **Automation:** Utilize Ansible to streamline the deployment and configuration of various components within the lab.
* **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions, configuration guides, and troubleshooting steps to help navigate and understand the lav environment effectively.
